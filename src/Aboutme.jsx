      <h6 className="abttitle2">Early Life and Education</h6>
      <p className="abtp2">Born and raised in the vibrant state of Maharashtra, I spent my formative years immersed in the bustling city of Mumbai. From a young age, I was captivated by the world of technology and computers, a fascination that only grew as I progressed through my school years.</p>

      <h6 className="abttitle2">The Beginning of My Coding Journey</h6>
      <p className="abtp2">My coding journey began in 2018, during my 8th grade at school. It was in these early computer lectures that I first encountered HTML. The ability to create and structure content on a webpage sparked a curiosity that I eagerly pursued. By the time I reached 9th grade, I had moved on to learning basic CSS, experimenting with styling documents and bringing static HTML pages to life. However, despite my growing interest, I faced a significant hurdle: the lack of a personal computer at home. Coupled with the intense focus required for my 10th grade board exams, I had to temporarily put my coding aspirations on hold.</p>

      <h6 className="abttitle2">Rediscovering My Passion</h6>
      <p className="abtp2">The turning point came in 2021, during my 11th grade. My school curriculum included JavaScript, which re-ignited my passion for coding. I delved into PHP, IoT, server-side scripting, and explored emerging fields like cybersecurity and AI during my 12th grade IT classes. This comprehensive exposure to various facets of computer science not only revived my interest but also solidified my determination to pursue a career in this field.</p>

      <h6 className="abttitle2">A Year of Intensive Learning</h6>
      <p className="abtp2">After completing my 12th boards, I decided to take a gap year before enrolling in college for a BE in Information Technology. This decision proved to be pivotal. I dedicated this period to honing my coding skills, diving deep into HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I also explored vanilla JS and React JS, building a variety of projects to apply my knowledge practically. Additionally, I started learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), recognizing their importance in developing efficient and optimized code. Platforms like LeetCode became my go-to for practicing and improving my problem-solving skills.</p>

      <h6 class="abttitle2">Looking Forward</h6>
      <p class="abtp2">Today, I am a passionate Full Stack and React Developer, continuously seeking to expand my knowledge and expertise. My journey from a curious school student to a dedicated developer has been filled with challenges and learning opportunities. Each step has reinforced my love for coding and my commitment to creating seamless digital experiences. As I move forward, I am excited about the endless possibilities in the field of technology and eager to contribute to innovative and impactful projects.</p>
